Before you submit a pull request for your lesson, you should review it yourself first. 

And if you're assigned to be the reviewer, then what do you look for when you're reviewing curriculum? 

The following lessons are checklists for you- whether you've written the initial draft or whether you're the curriculum reviewer- to follow as you go through lessons. 

If you're the reviewer, make sure that you've read this curriculum guide in its entirety. When you make have questions, comments, or feedback, make them directly in the Pull Request by clicking next to the line numbers in the PR files which will open up a comment box. 

Also, don't just point out the areas that need improvement. Point out too the things that are working. Praise generously and be positive.
